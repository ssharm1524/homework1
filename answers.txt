What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
'Git merge' creates a new merge commit, maintaining a clear history of when branches were merged, while 'git rebase' 
replays the changes onto the tip of another branch, creating a linear history that appears as if the changes were made 
sequentially. Merging preserves branch histories, making it suitable for collaboration, while rebasing is used for 
cleaner, more linear histories, ideal for feature branches or when preparing for a clean merge onto a main development branch.
