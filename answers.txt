What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
'Git merge' creates a new merge commit, maintaining a clear history of when branches were merged, while 'git rebase' 
replays the changes onto the tip of another branch, creating a linear history that appears as if the changes were 
made sequentially. Merging preserves branch histories, making it suitable for collaboration, while rebasing is used 
for cleaner, more linear histories, ideal for feature branches or when preparing for a clean merge onto a main 
development branch. 

What is a remote repository?
Remote repositories serve as a shared and collaborative hub for a team of developers working on the same project. 
Remote repositories store the project's complete history, branches, and code changes, allowing multiple contributors 
to push their local changes to the remote and pull the latest updates from it. This essential feature of distributed 
version control systems like Git enables seamless collaboration, code backup, and easy distribution of software 
projects among team members or the broader community.
