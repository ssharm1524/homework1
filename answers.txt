What is a remote repository?
Remote repositories serve as a shared and collaborative hub for a team of developers working on the same project. 
Remote repositories store the project's complete history, branches, and code changes, allowing multiple contributors 
to push their local changes to the remote and pull the latest updates from it. This essential feature of distributed 
version control systems like Git enables seamless collaboration, code backup, and easy distribution of software 
projects among team members or the broader community.
